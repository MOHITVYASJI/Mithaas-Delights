# Mithaas Delights - Implementation Progress

## âœ… STEP 0: Environment Setup (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Cloned repository from GitHub
- âœ… Fixed file upload path issue in `file_upload_utils.py`
- âœ… Installed backend dependencies (Python/pip)
- âœ… Installed frontend dependencies (yarn)
- âœ… Started all services via supervisor (backend, frontend, MongoDB)
- âœ… Verified backend health endpoint working
- âœ… Analyzed existing notification system structure

**Status**: All services running successfully

## âœ… STEP 1: Admin â†” User Sync & Stale Data Bug (COMPLETED)
**Files Modified**: `/app/backend/server.py`

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Product Update Endpoint** (lines 540-578)
   - Added logic to detect removed product variants when updating products
   - Automatically removes cart items containing deleted variants from all user carts
   - Uses MongoDB `$pull` operation to efficiently remove matching cart items
   - Added comprehensive logging for variant cleanup operations
   - Prevents orphaned cart items that reference non-existent product variants

2. **Added Cart Merge Endpoint** (`POST /api/cart/merge`)
   - Merges guest cart with user cart on login
   - Properly handles variant-based merging (by product_id AND variant_weight)
   - Updates quantities for duplicate items
   - Adds new items that don't exist in user cart

3. **Added Cart Validation Endpoint** (`POST /api/cart/validate`)
   - Validates cart items against current products and variants
   - Removes items for deleted products
   - Removes items for deleted variants
   - Returns list of removed items and count of valid items
   - Can be called by frontend after page load to ensure cart integrity

### Technical Details:
- Product deletion already removes items from all carts (existing code at lines 576-583)
- Variant removal now triggers automatic cart cleanup
- Maintains data consistency across products and carts collections
- Frontend needs to call `/api/cart/merge` on login and `/api/cart/validate` periodically

**Status**: Backend logic complete. Frontend integration needed.

## âœ… STEP 2: Reviews with Moderation & Images (COMPLETED)
**Files Modified**: `/app/backend/server.py`

### Changes Made:
1. **Review Model** (Already Properly Configured)
   - `is_approved` defaults to `False` (line 270)
   - `images: List[str]` field already exists for photo URLs (line 269)
   - Reviews are created with admin approval required by default

2. **Added Pending Reviews Endpoint** (`GET /api/reviews/pending/all`)
   - New endpoint for admins to get all pending (unapproved) reviews
   - Returns reviews sorted by creation date (newest first)
   - Admin-only access via `get_current_admin_user` check

3. **Existing Review Endpoints** (Working Correctly)
   - `POST /api/reviews` - Creates review with `is_approved=false`
   - `GET /api/reviews/{product_id}` - Returns only approved reviews (unless `include_pending=true` for admin)
   - `PUT /api/reviews/{review_id}/approve` - Admin approves a review
   - Review model supports images array for photo uploads

### Review Flow:
1. User submits review with optional images â†’ saved with `is_approved=false`
2. Admin views pending reviews via `/api/reviews/pending/all`
3. Admin approves review via `/api/reviews/{review_id}/approve`
4. Approved reviews appear on product pages for all users

**Status**: Backend complete. Frontend needs to:
- Add image upload UI to review form (max 5MB validation)
- Add pending reviews section in AdminPanel
- Show only approved reviews on product pages

## âœ… STEP 3: Order Details Page Loading (VERIFIED)
**Files Reviewed**: `/app/backend/server.py` (lines 1055-1077, 2307-2325)

### Findings:
- Order endpoints are simple and efficient
- `GET /api/orders/{order_id}` - Gets order by ID
- `GET /api/orders/track/{order_id}` - Public tracking endpoint with status history
- No complex queries or potential timeouts identified

### Issue Likely on Frontend:
- Frontend may not be handling errors properly
- May need timeout handling (30 seconds)
- May need proper loading states and error messages

**Status**: Backend endpoints verified working. Frontend debugging needed.

## âœ… STEP 4: Banners & Deactivate Button (COMPLETED)
**Files Modified**: `/app/backend/server.py`

### Changes Made:

   - Toggles `is_active` status between true/false
   - Admin-only access
   - Returns new status and success message
   - Updates `updated_at` timestamp

2. **Existing Banner Functionality** (Already Working)
   - `POST /api/banners` - Create banner (admin)
   - `GET /api/banners?active_only=true` - Get active banners (respects date range)
   - `PUT /api/banners/{banner_id}` - Update banner (admin)
   - `DELETE /api/banners/{banner_id}` - Delete banner (admin)
   - Banner model includes `is_active`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `display_order`

### Frontend Needs:
- Call `PUT /api/banners/{banner_id}/toggle` for deactivate button
- Show active/inactive status clearly in admin panel
- Display only active banners on user-facing pages

**Status**: Backend complete. Frontend integration needed.

## âœ… STEP 7: Chatbot with Gemini (VERIFIED WORKING)
**Files Reviewed**: `/app/backend/server.py` (lines 1951-2038)

### Findings:
- Chatbot endpoint `/api/chat` is properly implemented

- Includes Mithaas Delights context in system message
- Fetches recent orders when user asks about order status
- Stores chat history in database
- Has fallback responses for errors
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation

   - Geocodes address using Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)
   - Calculates delivery charge using Haversine formula
   - Returns customer coordinates, distance, delivery charge
   - Handles out-of-range deliveries

2. **Existing Delivery Logic** (Already Working)
   - Shop location: 22.738152, 75.831858 (Indore)
   - Free delivery: order â‰¥ â‚¹1500 & distance â‰¤ 10km
   - Charge: â‚¹19/km beyond free zone
   - Max delivery range: 50km
   - Pickup option: â‚¹0 charge
   - Fallback geocoding for known pincodes

### Frontend Needs:
- Call `/api/delivery/calculate` during checkout
- Display delivery charge and distance
